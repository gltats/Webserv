Here's an overview of the key functionalities and structures in the code:

Constructor and Destructor:

The CgiHandler class has constructors for initializing the CGI handler with the relevant server and request information.
The destructor is responsible for cleaning up resources, including environment variables used during CGI execution.
Environment Variables Initialization:

The _initEnvironmentVariables method sets up environment variables needed for the CGI execution. These include information such as content length, content type, script name, script filename, etc.
Handling CGI Execution:

The startCgiHandler method is called to initiate the CGI execution based on the type of script (Python or binary).
The _handlePythonScript and _handleBinaryScript methods handle the specifics of executing Python scripts and binary executables, respectively.
File Handling:

Temporary files are created for input and output, and the body of the request is written to the input file.
File descriptors and streams are used to manage input and output redirection.
Process Execution and Monitoring:

The fork system call is used to create a child process for executing the CGI script.
The parent process monitors the child process and checks for potential issues like infinite loops or errors.
Response Handling:

The CGI handler captures the output of the CGI script and sets it as the response body.
HTTP status codes (e.g., 200, 500) are returned based on the success or failure of the CGI execution.
Environment Variables Conversion:

_getEnvironmentVariables converts a map of environment variables into a format suitable for the execve function.
Content Type Mapping:

_getContentTypeHeader maps file extensions to corresponding content types.
Print Message:

The printMessage method outputs a message indicating that the CGI handler is being called.
This CGI handler is designed to work in conjunction with a web server, executing CGI scripts and managing the interaction between the server and the scripts based on HTTP requests. The code demonstrates handling both Python and binary scripts, error checking, and proper resource management.
