# install the postman desktop or the postman agent to be able to send requests to the localhost
# example 1:
    select method GET
    127.0.0.1:4432/html/index.html

# example 2:
    select method GET
    127.0.0.1:4432/html/basic.html  

if you use "hostname" instead of "127.0.0.1" it will send an IPv6 request instead of a IPv4
which will not work on the webserver
